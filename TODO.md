TO DO LIST:
•	Stretch material for all weeks (mostly week 5)—do the katas and shit
•	The Modern JavaScript Tutorial (I could read and do in Rotorua)**
•	Ask Joseph if he recommends any projects**
•	CodeAcademy(optional)--
•	Maybe try build a practice website? Do some cool stuff?. I don’t know.-- 
•	Scope and “lexical this”
        —Anything within a function is accessible to each other i.e. a function within a function can access the entire environment within the parent function. 


•       Promises
•	.then and .catch syntax
•	Fetch api
•	High order array functions—forEach, Filter, Map
•	Concept of components and state
•	Learn recursion
•	What is closures
        —Closures in JavaScript are able to access all variables within its lexical scope. This means that a function within a function can access all variables defined within its parent function even though it is finished and executed first. 
	

•   What is AJAX?
•	Async/await
•	Practice using functional methods
•	Destructuring
        —kind of learnt it. I at least get the idea of the shortcut access to the object properties without having to call the property on the object each time. Just assign the variable with the squirly brackets.
